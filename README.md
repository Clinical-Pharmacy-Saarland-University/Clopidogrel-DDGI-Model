# Clopidogrel-DDGI-Model
Modeling of published clinical clopidogrel studies for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model for clopidogrel and its metabolites clopidogrel carboxylic acid, clopidogrel acyl glucuronide, 2-oxo-clopidogrel, as well as the active metabolite clopidogrel thiol H4. The model was developed using published clinical studies and its predictive performance was evaluated within our DDI network. The file "Clopidogrel-Model" contains simulations of the published clinical studies used during model establishment, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. For further details, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation, please refer to [1]. Furthermore, the DDI files contain simulations of published clinical DDI studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of the tacrolimus model regarding DDIs with the perpetrator drugs omeprazole and rifampicin as well as the victim drugs repaglinide, pioglitazone, montelukast, and bupropion, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied omeprazole, rifampicin, repaglinide, pioglitazone, montelukast, and bupropion models have been published previously [2-6].
